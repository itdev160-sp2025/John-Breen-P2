The Library Book App
Took me a lot of brainstorming to come up with an idea for this project. Funny enough I was actually walking through the Library when the idea hit me;
A Lirbary Book App that allows users to view, add, and filter books. This app handles content injection into the page, and also user interaction events.

Feature List
-View Book List: Users can see a list of books displayed dynamically

-Add a New Book: Users can add new books by submitting a form

-Filter Books: Users can filter books by genre or availability

-Dynamic Content: Book data will be stored in an array and rendered 

-Event Handling: Handle form submissions and filter selections
